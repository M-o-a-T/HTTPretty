 disclaimer:
 ~~~~~~~~~~~
 .
 Due to big API incompatibility between python 3.3, 3.4 and 3.5, the
 author of HTTPretty is **not** supporting python3 officially. You will
 notice that the travis build for python 3 might be broken, and while
 pull requests fixing py3 support are most welcome, it is still not
 official at least *for now*.
